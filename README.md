Who am I? Someone that's afraid to give their sword uh

You decide, if I should go mining all these ores yeah

Suicide, cause I just fell off a giant mountain, uh

The mobs they kill me

The mobs they kill me

You decide, if I should go mining all these ores yeah

Suicide, cause I just fell off a giant mountain, uh

The mobs they kill me

I gave her everything she..

Took my diamonds away from me

My pick's been so broken lately

I won't fight I'd rather mine. :(

I'm lost in the mineshaft

But I can dig my way out

I love when I build but

The griefers destroy my house
